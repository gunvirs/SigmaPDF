The two different mesh are the set up to run the liquid Jet case
used as reference for the ELSA and the Sigma-Y-PDF , [1,2] .

The first case , struct_mesh , is a structured mesh, with orthogonal cells. 
The second case, cyl_mesh, presents a cylindrical mesh. 
In this latter, is present the bash file blkmsh.sh to create the mesh. 

It is worth noting that, to  use the Klein digital filter as inlet condition, the inlet patch MUST have a normal parallel to the axis X. This is due to a bug present in the boundary condition related. I'll fix it someday. Until then be carefoul of that.
